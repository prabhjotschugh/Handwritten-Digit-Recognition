# Handwritten Digit Recognition

Handwritten digit recognition is an Artificial Intelligence Project that is used to classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9, inclusively; with the help of Neural Networks. I have used MNIST dataset which contains 60,000 small square 28×28 pixel grayscale images. 

The model uses a three-layered Neural Network :

•	Input layer: It distributes the features of our examples to the next layer for calculation of activations of the next layer.

•	Hidden layer: They are made of hidden units called activations providing nonlinear ties for the network. A number of hidden layers can vary according to our requirements.

•	Output layer: The nodes here are called output units. It provides us with the final prediction of the Neural Network on the basis of which final predictions can be made.
